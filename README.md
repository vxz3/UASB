## Semester Goals:
In the Spring 2018 semester, the UASB team will be working on finalizing designs for the pilot scale UASB intially proposed in the 2017 EPA P3 Phase I grant.  More specifically, we will be designing a hydraulic inlet system, and designing, and updating the biogas capture/storage system.  We will also be writing a Phase II grant to get funding for the fabrication and testing of a second pilot scale UASB.
